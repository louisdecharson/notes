* What's AWK ?

Awk is powerful command line tool for text processing. It's incredibly useful to
quickly search through logs or csv files. Because it's part of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX][POSIX]] - a family of standards for
operating systems, awk is installed on almost every /computer/ by default, from a
UNIX server to your mobile phone.
